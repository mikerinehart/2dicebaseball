# 2 Dice Baseball

A simple baseball game similar to dice baseball where you roll two dice and it determines the outcome per out in an inning of baseball.

The project is currently implemented in JavaScript, but I have plans to rewrite it in PHP, Python, C, C#, and C++. Additionally, I aim to develop a front end using HTML, React, Vue, and Angular, with a Node.js backend connected to a NoSQL database for a comprehensive application.

## Deployment

To deploy this project put the files in a directory and open index.html in a browser. Click the "Play New Game" button to see the results.

There are console logs for informative messages that describe the action and help with debugging if I missed a case for a hit + base runners scenario.

The code uses simple base running where if a runner is on third and the batter hits a single or double, the runner will stay on third. Feel free to modify as you see fit.
